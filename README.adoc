= Dockerize your application with AsciiDoctor-reveal.js image

Live-edit and present your AsciiDoctor-reveal.js slides.

== Usage

=== 1. Create your Slides

You can follow this https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/[tutorial]
or check the samples in `test` directory to create your
slides using AsciiDoctor.

=== 2. Add Reveal.js Submodule

You will need `reveal.js` scripts on the same directory as
your slides to make it work:

```bash
git submodule add git://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git
```

=== 3. Start your container

Run the following command to create a container:

```bash
docker run --rm -t -v "$PWD/test":/opt/slides -p 8000:8000 -e INDEX=history.html jeqo/asciidoctor-reveal.js
```

Map your volumes correctly to the directory where your slides
are, in this case `./test`, then map the `8000` port, then (optionally)
add `INDEX` environment variable to override the default URL when you open
your browser pointing to `http://localhost:8000` and that's it.

Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8000
